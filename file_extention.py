# ü§î This program has a lot of potential, but so far it can only generate two drawings

# ü™æ Add at least two more branches to the conditional 
#    so that the program can draw more than just a square and a circle

# ‚ùóÔ∏è An elif statement will probably be useful here.

# üî∫ For example, your program could also draw a triangle and a pentagon.
